# What is Linux
● Linux is a kernel.
## History of Linux
● In 1969 a team led by computer scientists Ken
Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created the first
version of UNIX on a PDP-7 minicomputer,
# WHAT is kernel?
● Kernel is a
code/program that used
to meet your Software and Hardware. And allocate some resources.
● Richard Stallman announced the GNU Linux
project in 1983 and cofounded the Free
Software Foundation in 1985.
● GNU is a free software replacement to the UNIX
OS, But it was just software replacement not full
os {Examples: Bash,tar,emacs…} .
● So GNU + LINUX will give the GNU/Linux OS.
● The GNU Linux project was started to create a
Unix-like operating system created with source
code that could be copied, modified, and
redistributed
# What is Shell?
● Users communicate with the
kernel by the shell.
● The Shell is a Command Line
Interpreter. It translates
commands entered by the user
and converts them into a
language that is understood by
the Kernel.
# Types of shells

# Why Linux?
● Most used
● Most hacking tools
● Most Secured!
# Linux distributions/distro
● Distro is Modified Linux Kernels,type of operating systems with different:
So many distros…
