## Introduction to Python Programming
# What is Programming language
● It is language which helps to communicate with computers
{they are not able to understand human languages}
● We humans have lots of
languages(english,france,amharic,arabic..)
● Computers have this languages to
○ Assembly,C,C++,Java,Javascript,Python,Ruby,Perl,Go….
● Prog lang. Helps us to write programs using those languages
# What is Program?
● A program is an algorithm expressed in a programming
language.
● An algorithm is a detailed sequence of actions to perform to
accomplish some task. Named after an Iranian mathematician,
Al-Khwarizmi.
● Technically, an algorithm must reach a result after a finite
number of steps.
● With those steps Programs Do a Specific task Correctly
# Algorithm Example
● To ask someone his/her name
a. You Walk to the person
b. Greetings
c. Wait for answer back
d. “What is your name?”
● This will be a lot of kinds of algorithms to do a specific task
# Evolution of I/O { Input / Output }
● Early in the history of computing, programs were submitted on
punch cards with all the data they required and executed together
with other programs that used the same libraries. Output was to a
line printer.
● Later developments introduced interactive processing which
allowed the user to provide data while the program was running.
This normally takes place in a Question & Answer format.
# Generation of Computers
1. First Generation: Vacuum Tubes => punch cards
2. Second Generation: Transistors => Programming started here with Assembly
3. Third Generation: Integrated Circuits => BASIC, COBOL, Pascal, Fortran, C, C++, Perl and Ada
4. Fourth Generation: Microprocessors => Python, SQL,Matlab
5. Fifth Generation: Artificial Intelligence
they could only solve one problem
at a time. It would take operators
days or even weeks to set up a new
Program on First Generation.
# Transistors
* Small electronic Device that changed the world.
# Types of Programming Languages
● Computers Understand binary(0/1) , humans
don’t understand this
● SO based on the closeness of the language to
humans we classify it into 3
● The more they become low to the machine they
are faster.
● The more they become like human language they
are slower.
# A) LOW level programming language
● These languages are more
like machines but with lots
of effort people can
understand them. They
are close to the hardware
of the computer.
● Ex: Assembly
# B) High level Programming languages
● They are more close to
human languages.
● Example:
Python,C++,Java,JS…
# C) Medium Level
● Languages Between Low
level and High level, they
combine both
● Ex: C-lang
# How do high level languages work?
As we saw earlier we have said that computers know only binarys, and if we code
with high level languages how do computers understand us?
1) Compilers: are tools which helps to convert the whole code to bytecode then
computer will execute it
a) Example: C,C++,Java,..
2) Interpreter: can directly execute the code by reading the source code line by
line
a) Example: python
# Uses of Programming language
● Android Application Development
● Website Development
● Machine learning
● Artificial Intelligence
● Game Development
● Big data Technology
● Desktop software development
● Hacking tool development
# What is Python Programming?
● Python is a High level & interpreted programming
language. => Very easy to learn
● It is Very SImplified language any one can write with it,
also can read it.
# History of python
● Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and
early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and
Computer Science in the Netherlands.
● Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC,
Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other
scripting languages.
● Python is now maintained by a core development team at the
institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in
directing it's progress.
# Uses of Python
● Data visualization
● Data analysis
● Machine learning
● Artificial intelligence
● Back-end web development (with frameworks like Django and Flask)
● Game development
● Hacking Script writing
# Install python
● On windows you will
download python from their
website
● On linux it comes pre
installed, else apt install
python3
Website:
https://www.python.org/
# IDE & Code editors
● IDE ( Integrated Development Enviroment ): Is a
Software that helps to write & run a Specific Programming
language. Example: PythonIDE
● Code Editors: are softwares those can help to write any
kind of programming languages. And also by adding some
compiling/ interpreting feature they can run
programs/scripts Example: Sublime,Vscode
* How to use Vscode for linux
After Installing python we have to configure somethings on VScode to run
python
* Outputs and COmments
● On python, to display output we use keyword ‘print’
● Syntax: print(object=’’, sep=’’, end=’’)
\n - new line
\t - tab space
print(text1,text2,text3…)
* Comments
● This are a simple notes written on our codes those can help as to remember the function
of the code or to make it simple for peoples to understand our code.
● Comments won’t be executed.
● Syntax: # This is a comment line
* Python Keywords
Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in Python programming that have special
meanings to the compiler.
# Variables
● Variables are a value holders /containers/
● They store data
● We give some value to some word.
● example : number = 10 => from now on my python program knows the value of
number is 10.
● The process of giving value to word is called Variable Declaration
● The word that holds the data is called Identifier
● We can Print value of variables by giving the identifier
We can change value of variable in a code.
● You can print the variable with {variableName} on
print keyword
● Syntax: print(f”yourtext {variable}”)
Remember!
On naming the identifier:
a) Dont use space between words use _
b) Dont use numbers as identifier
# Data types
● Have you seen the data types we used on the variable slide?
● There are a lot of Data types on python
# A) Numeric Data type
● int(integer) - holds signed integers of non-limited length.
● float - holds floating decimal points and it's accurate up to 15 decimal places.
● complex - holds complex numbers.
★ You can Identify The type of a variable with the keyword ‘type()’
# B) String Data
● String is a sequence of characters represented by either single or double quotes. For
example, var = “ ” or var =
# C) Sequence Data
A) Lists
a) List is an ordered collection of similar or different types of items separated by
commas and enclosed within brackets [ ]. For example, languages =
["Swift", "Java", "Python"]
b) To access items from a list, we use the index number (0, 1, 2 ...). For
example, languages[0]
c) We can add/modify objects to the list, languages.append(“Amharic”)
# 2) Tuple
● Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as a list. The only difference is that tuples are
immutable. Tuples once created cannot be modified.
● we use the parentheses () to store items of a tuple. For example, product = ('Xbox', 499.99)
● Similar to lists, we use the index number to access tuple items in Python
# D) Dictionary data
● Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. It stores elements in key/value
pairs.
○ user1 = {'username':’nathan26,’password’:’p@$$word’}
■ username and password = key
■ nathan26 & p@$$word = value
● We use keys to retrieve the respective value. But not the other way around. For example,
# CLASS IS OVER
